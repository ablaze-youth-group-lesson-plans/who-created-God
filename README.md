# Grade 9 Science

- exercise in textbook was, let's say you're in a grocery aisle, and your looking for a can of some particular food. And among the competing brands, you see one can with an ad that says "20% less"
- Q: what deeper questions should you ask yourself about that ad?
- A: one of my classmates said, "20% less than what?"

## Sproul's The Existence of Shoes

- https://www.ligonier.org/learn/series/objections-answered/the-existence-of-shoes/

- Take off my shoe and put it on the table.
  Q. Brainstorm 4 possible explanations for how this shoe began to exist?
  A.

1. it's an illusion (even if it were, what's having the illusion, is the illusion real?)
1. self-existent and eternal
1. shoe created itself out of nothing
1. shoe was made by someone/thing other than that shoe

Q. Do you grant that this shoe exists and is not an illusion? A. scratch that option off the list

# Station 1 - Law of non-contradiction

1. it's an illusion (even if it were, what's having the illusion, is the illusion real?)
1. self-existent and eternal
1. shoe created itself out of nothing
1. shoe was made by someone/thing other than that shoe

   By the power of logic, we can eliminate one of the above options.
   Given the law of non-contradiction which states that "something cannot be both true and not true at the same time and in the same relationship"
   For example, something cannot "be" and "not be" at the same time/relationship
   And given the fundamental scientific law "ex nihilo, nihil fit" which is Latin for "out of nothing, nothing comes"
   which of your above listed possible explanations can be eliminated?

# Station 2 - Eternal God

- Compare Gen 1:1 vs John 1:1-3 vs Ps 90:2
  Q. How does God reveal Himself in relation to time?  
  Q. Is God dependent on the existence of time?
  Q. Basic math: IF x + 1 = 0, what does x equal? (this is an easy warmup for the next question)
  Q. If science says the beginning of the universe was the start of all matter, energy, space and time itself,
  then if God created the universe, what attributes must He have?

# Station 3 - Worldviews Chart

- Based on the evidences listed in this chart, what bias does the author have?
- If the age of the universe is infinite (has no beginning), which of the listed worldviews would be compatible?
- Since the age of the universe is finite (has a beginning), which of the listed worldviews can not be true?
- One of the fundamental laws of science is "Ex Nihilo nihil fit" which is latin for "Out of nothing, nothing comes". In other words,
  something can't come from nothing.
- With the remaining worldviews, List the noun (person/place or thing) that is credited to the universe's beginnings.
- Which of those are things that are created?
- Which worldview credits a non-created being for the universe's beginnings?
- When someone asks "What does the number 8 taste like?" -- What's wrong with that question?
  Q: Therefore, What is wrong about the question, "Who created God?"

# Station 4 - Coin flip

Q. What are the mathematical odds (assuming it doesn't stand on its edge), that the coin will come up heads OR tails? A. 100% (tricky question ;)

- Q. Okay, What are odds that the coin comes up heads? A. 50%
- Q. What are the odds that the coin comes up tails? A. 50%
- Someone flips a coin 10 times in a row and people have to record how many times it turns up heads/tails.
  Q. If the odds are 50% heads and it flips heads for one turn, does chance somehow dictate that the next flip will be tails?
  Q. Does chance have memory?
  Q. Does chance have influence on the next event?
  Q. Why doesn't chance have power to influence anything?
  Q. When atheistic scientists say the universe was created "by chance" -- what are they really saying?

## Station 1 - Shoe existence - Play Prince.mp4 5mins

- nothing can create itself because it violates basic law of non-contradiction - something cannot be A and not A at the same time/relationship
- for a shoe to create itself, it would have to be before it was. It would both have to be a shoe and not a shoe in the same time/relationship

Therefore, if you grant the reality of the shoe, then you must admit, there has never been a time where there was nothing, there always had to be something, or nothing could be now.

If something exists now, then something somehow somewhere must have the power to make whatever is here, be here. Something must have the power of being.
Q. if something exists now, could there ever have been a time that there was absolutely nothing?
A. No

So far what have we proven through this? if it's not an illusion, that shoe did not create itself. We're still left with 2 options.

## Station 2 - Eternal God

Q. Can God create Himself?
A: No. Therefore, he is self-existent, eternal, uncreated, not made, and exists IN HIS OWN POWER. There was never a second where he didn't exist.

Q. Why don't we say the universe is self-existent and eternal which is what scientists say. Scientists say we don't have to go to a transcendent God to explain universe, there must be a part of the universe (point of singularity, quantum pulse of power that is eternal though undiscovered).
A. Scientists aren't talking about the whole universe, and when they say nothing, they don't actually mean nothing.
When we as Christians say God is transcendent, which means above/beyond the universe, we don't mean transcendent in spatial/geographic terms, we mean God is a different sort of being than creaturely being. He alone has self-existence.

- self-creation (yet this is the one that scientists argue applies to how the universe began)
- self creation presupposes that the universe came into being out of nothing, by nothing, through the power of nothing, which is nonsense.
- So far we now show it's not irrational to believe in a self-existent eternal being. There is now law of rationality that is violated by the concept of - self-existence. Self creation is irrational. Self existence is rational. So now we're left with 2 choices, if something exists, then it's either self-existent, or it's created by something that ultimately is self-existent.

* One of the reasons we worship God is because God alone has the power of being in Himself, and everything that is, is dependent on Him for their existence

Notice, with both options, if something exists, either it was self-existent, or created by something that is ultimately self-existent, notice in both of those, it's logically necessary, that something is self-eternal and exists in and of itself.
